# Multifactor authentication (MFA)
One of the most important things to set up after creating the root account user is the multifactor authentication to ensure the security of the account and in this case, I chose The Microsoft Authenticator App which gerates a onetime code for every 3o seconds

# Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Identity and Access Management (IAM) serves as a fundamental AWS service essential for Solutions Architects.
IAM facilitates the creation of additional identities within an AWS account, allowing for the assignment of restricted access levels. Initially, IAM identities have no permissions within an AWS Account, but they can be granted permissions that closely align with those of the Account Root User.
